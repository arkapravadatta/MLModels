Problem:


A bank is planning to develop campaigns that more effectively target potential loan customers. The goal is to increase the conversion rate with minimal budget expenditure. 
To support this, the department seeks to build a predictive model to identify depositors with a high probability of purchasing a consumer loan. This model will enhance campaign efficiency by
focusing efforts on customers most likely to convert, thereby increasing the success ratio and reducing campaign costs.
The dataset contains information on customers' financial profiles, including their demographics, financial products, and services usage. 
This data can be used for various analytical purposes, such as understanding customer behaviour, financial product usage, and creditworthiness.
